If you own a Microsoft Azure account and you've purchased the SendGrid product from the Azure marketplace, you should know that you are limited to **two SendGrid accounts** per Azure subscription.

Whenever you will try to create a third account you will encounter this error on your dashboard:

This limit exists for security and compliance reasons in order to prevent abuse.
